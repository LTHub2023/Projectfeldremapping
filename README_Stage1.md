# üß† FDF Remapper ‚Äì Initial Working Version (VB.NET / .NET 2.0)

This is the first working version of a console application that remaps field names in `.fdf` form files using mappings defined in a local Access database (`.mdb`).

It was developed for structured form processing workflows (e.g., clinical trial PDFs, medical case report forms), and supports both 1:1 and 1:N mappings.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Features in This Version

- ‚úÖ Field name mapping via Access `.mdb` file
- ‚úÖ Supports both **1:1** (direct) and **1:N** (value-based) mappings
- ‚úÖ Outputs a log file indicating successful replacements
- ‚ùå No log entries for unchanged lines yet
- ‚ùå No support for keys with suffixes (e.g., `FieldName_2`)
- üñ•Ô∏è Designed to run on .NET Framework 2.0

## üßæ Sample Log Output

> Note: Lines that are not changed are **not logged** in this version.

```
Line 9: [1:1] Replaced 'FieldA' with 'StandardFieldA'
Line 10: [1:N] Replaced 'FieldB' with 'StandardFieldB' (Value: ValueX)
Line 11: [1:1] Replaced 'FieldC' with 'StandardFieldC'
```

## üß™ How It Works

1. The tool loads a mapping table from a local Access `.mdb` file.
2. It processes the `.fdf` file line by line.
3. If a matching mapping is found:
   - For **1:1**, the field name is replaced directly.
   - For **1:N**, the replacement is based on matching the field‚Äôs value.
4. Replacements are logged line by line in a `.log` file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Edit `Program.vb` with correct file paths:

```vbnet
Dim dbPath As String = "C:\YourPath\Mapping.mdb"
Dim fdfFilePath As String = "C:\Input\YourFile.fdf"
Dim outputPath As String = "C:\Output\ModifiedFile.fdf"
Dim formname As String = "FormNameUsedInMapping"
```

### Compile using Visual Studio or command line:

```bash
vbc /target:exe /out:FDFRemapper.exe Program.vb
```

### Run:

The tool will generate:
- A modified `.fdf` file with replaced field names
- A `.log` file showing the lines that were changed
